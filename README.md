# DVA test using - Spring Data

I based this application on the Sprint Data example.
I created Person and Claim domain objects and connect the objects with OneToMany and ManyToOne relationships.
I then created a from page to browse the seed data and added a collapse button to show and hide the claims content.

I built this application using IntelliJ IDEA on Mac OSX.  I have included all the files here.

I run the application from within the IDE and also run the test from within the IDE.

This is my first attempt at building a Spring application, so nothing fancy ;).
